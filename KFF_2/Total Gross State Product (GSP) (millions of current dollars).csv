"*GSP*: Gross State Product is a measurement of a state's output; it is the sum of value added from all industries in the state. GSP is the state counterpart to the Nation's gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the market value of goods and services produced by labor and property in the United States, regardless of nationality. Current dollar GSP components are compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports, and gross-operating surplus."
