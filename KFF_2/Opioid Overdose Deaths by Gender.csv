"Notes"
"The National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files were used to identify drug overdose deaths. Drug overdose deaths were classified using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), based on the ICD-10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–44 (unintentional), X60–64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent). Among the deaths with drug overdose as the underlying cause, the type of opioid involved is indicated by the following ICD-10 multiple cause-of-death codes: opioids (T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, or T40.6); natural and semisynthetic opioids (T40.2); methadone (T40.3); synthetic opioids, other than methadone (T40.4); and heroin (T40.1)."

"Deaths from illegally-made fentanyl cannot be distinguished from pharmaceutical fentanyl in the data source. For this reason, deaths from both legally prescribed and illegally produced fentanyl are included in these data."
""
"Rates presented in this data table represent age-adjusted rates per 100,000 population."

Footnotes
"1. Total number of male and total female opioid overdose deaths reported for the United States exclude opioid deaths in North Dakota in 2015, 2013 and 2011. In these years, the number of deaths are not available for the state by gender due to suppression constraints and are therefore excluded from the US totals."
"2. Total number of male, total female, and overall total opioid overdose deaths reported for the United States exclude opioid deaths in North Dakota 2012. In this year, the number of deaths are not available for the state due to suppression constraints and are therefore excluded from the US totals."
